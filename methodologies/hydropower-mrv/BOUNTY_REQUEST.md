# Request for Bounty Program Inclusion

## Why Hydropower MRV Deserves Bounty Consideration

### Global Impact
- **16% of global electricity** from hydropower (larger than solar at 4%)
- **1,300 GW installed capacity** worldwide
- **Critical for emerging markets** (China: 370 GW, Brazil: 109 GW, India: 51 GW)

### Methodology Gap
Current Guardian library covers:
- ✅ Afforestation (VM0047)
- ✅ Forest management (VM0010)
- ✅ Manure management
  

### Unique Technical Contributions
1. Device-level DID identities for turbines
2. Hydro-specific telemetry (flow rate, head height, capacity factor, pH, turbidity)
3. Real-time cryptographic verification (not periodic audits)
4. Multi-tier royalty system for RECs
5. Complete testnet deployment with evidence

### Verra Alignment
- VM0040: Methodology for Improved Hydrological Systems
- I-REC Standard compliance
- Gold Standard renewable energy requirements

## Request
We request DLT Earth/Exponential Science/HBAR Foundation to:
1. Add Hydropower MRV to the official bounty list
2. Or provide guidance on alternative funding/recognition pathways
3. Or accept as a pioneering general contribution with community recognition
